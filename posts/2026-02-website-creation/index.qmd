## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! I recently migrated my personal website from Jekyll to Quarto, and I wanted to document the process for anyone interested in doing something similar. This post will walk through the motivation, implementation, and lessons learned along the way.

## Why Quarto?

My website initially started as a simple Jekyll site with the minimal theme, hosting just my CV. While Jekyll served its purpose well, I wanted to expand the site to include a blog for sharing research insights, coding projects, and other interests. After exploring various options, I chose Quarto for several reasons:

1. **Academic-Friendly**: Quarto is designed with scientific and technical publishing in mind, making it perfect for someone in research
2. **Unified Tooling**: Unlike Jekyll which requires Ruby, Quarto uses a single tool for website generation, documents, presentations, and more
3. **Modern Features**: Built-in support for blogs, RSS feeds, and easy navigation
4. **Markdown Compatible**: My existing CV content required minimal changes
5. **Active Development**: Quarto is actively maintained by Posit (formerly RStudio) with excellent documentation

## The Migration Process

### Step 1: Converting from Jekyll

The first step was converting my existing Jekyll site to Quarto. This involved:

- Creating `_quarto.yml` configuration file to define the site structure
- Renaming `index.md` to `index.qmd` and adding YAML front matter
- Removing the old `_config.yml` Jekyll configuration

The CV content itself needed almost no changes - just adding a simple front matter block:

```yaml
---
title: "Kai Lynn Wong"
page-layout: full
toc: false
---
```

### Step 2: Setting Up the Blog Structure

Quarto makes blog setup straightforward. I created:

1. **Blog Listing Page** (`blog.qmd`): A page that automatically discovers and displays all blog posts
2. **Posts Directory** (`posts/`): Where all blog posts live, each in its own folder
3. **Metadata File** (`posts/_metadata.yml`): Default settings applied to all posts

The blog listing configuration uses Quarto's built-in listing feature:

```yaml
---
title: "Blog"
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  categories: true
  feed:
    type: full
---
```

This automatically:
- Discovers all posts in the `posts/` directory
- Sorts them by date (newest first)
- Enables category filtering
- Generates an RSS feed for subscribers

### Step 3: Configuring GitHub Actions

The final piece was setting up automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. I created a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) that:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Installs Quarto using the official `quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2` action
3. Renders the site with `quarto render`
4. Uploads the built site as an artifact
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages

The workflow uses the artifact-based deployment approach, which is GitHub's current recommended method for Pages deployment. This provides better reliability and debugging compared to older approaches.

## File Structure

The final file structure is clean and organized:

```
/
├── _quarto.yml              # Main configuration
├── index.qmd                # CV homepage
├── blog.qmd                 # Blog listing
├── posts/                   # All blog posts
│   ├── _metadata.yml        # Default post settings
│   └── 2026-02-website-creation/
│       └── index.qmd        # This post!
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── publish.yml      # Deployment automation
```

## Key Configuration Details

### Navigation

The `_quarto.yml` file defines a navigation bar with:
- Home (CV) and Blog links
- GitHub and email icons for easy contact
- Clean, professional appearance using the Cosmo theme

### Styling

I chose the `cosmo` theme for its clean, modern look that's similar to the Jekyll minimal theme I was using before. The `page-layout: full` setting gives the CV maximum width for better readability.

### Blog Posts

Each blog post lives in its own directory (e.g., `posts/2026-02-website-creation/`), which makes it easy to:
- Include post-specific images
- Keep related resources together
- Maintain a clean, organized structure

## Lessons Learned

1. **Quarto Documentation is Excellent**: The official Quarto documentation is comprehensive and well-organized. I found answers to almost every question there.

2. **GitHub Actions Setup is Critical**: Make sure to configure your GitHub repository settings correctly - set Pages source to "GitHub Actions" rather than "Deploy from a branch".

3. **Local Testing Helps**: If you have Quarto installed locally, running `quarto preview` before pushing helps catch issues early.

4. **Minimal Migration Required**: The actual content migration was surprisingly simple - most of the work was in setting up the new structure and configuration.

## Adding New Blog Posts

For future reference (and for anyone following along), here's how to add a new blog post:

1. Create a new directory: `posts/YYYY-MM-post-title/`
2. Create `index.qmd` in that directory
3. Add YAML front matter with title, date, description, and categories
4. Write your content in Markdown
5. Commit and push to main branch
6. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys

## What's Next

Now that the infrastructure is in place, I'm excited to start sharing more content. I plan to write about:

- Research projects and findings from my work on *Cryptosporidium*
- Coding projects and tools I'm building
- Bioinformatics techniques and workflows
- Tips and tricks for lab work and molecular biology

## Conclusion

Migrating from Jekyll to Quarto was a smooth process that took just a few hours. The result is a professional, modern website that serves both as a CV and a platform for sharing ideas. If you're considering a similar migration, I highly recommend Quarto - especially if you're in research or technical fields.
